					<p>Never before have governments and corporations been able to track and collect data about individuals like they can today. Examples of businesses overstepping their rights and tracking too much data about users are becoming commonplace. Tempers flared over the recent announcement that Reddit is now recording each time a user clicks a link that leads off of Reddit.com. HackerNews user PDKL95 claims “Unauthorized tracking should be a criminal offense”  and that the average person thinks marketers should be jailed for invading a user’s privacy without asking. Other users were surprised it took Reddit this long to implement link tracking. One commenter shared how his analytics team knows the exact buttons, links, and pages a user clicks.</p>
					<p>These types of articles bring out the privacy extremists, so we explored how they keep themselves safe and secure online - taking privacy to the extreme. The following 6 techniques range from things that everyday users can utilize, to things only the truly paranoid - or criminal - would need to use.</p>
					
					
					<h3 class="section-heading">1. Changing Sharing Habits and App Settings</h3>
					<p> A simple way to increase your online privacy is go ahead and type out that Facebook status, or upload your picture, but never click actually click the publish button. You’ll get the satisfaction of documenting your status but by simply adjusting your behavior to not share every little thing, or specifically choosing what mediums to share on, protects you from snooping eyes.  Similarly, adjusting the sharing settings on all your social profiles changes who can see your updates.</p>
					<h3 class="section-heading">2. AdBlocking</h3>
					<p>AdBlocking is the easiest way to stop websites from tracking you. A browser extension (like AdBlock Plus) blocks advertising and analytics scripts from running. Not only do your visits not show up in databases, but you don’t see ads either!</p>
					<h3 class="section-heading">3. Script Blocking</h3>
					<p>Some take AdBlock one step further with NoScript, which stops Javascript, Java, Flash, and other scripts from running without explicit permission. This breaks the functionality of some websites, requires a user to approve a script every time it runs, but also stops any tracking or nefarious code from running. As an added bonus, NoScript blocks the elements that traditionally have huge file sizes, so web browsing is much faster.</p>
					<h3 class="section-heading">4. Router-Level Blocking</h3>
					<p>Instead of blocking ads or scripts on an individual web browser, you can block them before they even get to a device. Blocking scripts with your router (with something like PiHole) stops scripts and ads on every device - computers, tablets, phones, and even gaming consoles.</p>
					<h3 class="section-heading">5. VPN (Virtual Private Network)</h3>
					<p>VPNs (wikipedia) are often used to give employees access to their employer’s servers, but can also be used to reroute internet traffic through external locations. This hides a user’s IP address, location, and other data, making it more difficult to track or identify. Problems occur when a VPN provider becomes compromised or is a served a warrant, and is forced to give up users’ information.</p>
					<h3 class="section-heading">5. VPN (Virtual Private Network)</h3>
					<p>Tor, used only by advanced technical users, is the almost entirely foolproof way of remaining anonymous online. Like a VPN, it reroutes your internet traffic. A VPN often only reroutes traffic once, while Tor can bounce it off multiple relays that are run by community members. Tor is theoretically impossible to compromise, so a user’s traffic will always be private.</p>
