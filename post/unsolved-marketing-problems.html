					<h2 class="section-heading">The List of The World’s Unsolved Marketing Problems</h2>
					
                        <img class="img-responsive" src="\img\apple-logo.jpeg" alt="">

                    <span class="caption text-muted">IMAGE CAPTION</span>
                    
					<p>If you haven’t gotten lost in Wikipedia’s beautiful lists of unsolved problems I highly, highly recommend it. Broken down into the major areas of study (computer science, medicine, philosophy, mathematics, etc), each list is filled with the big problems no one has been able to solve yet. The world’s wealth of knowledge and all of history’s geniuses haven’t been able to crack these problems. The lists include problems with prizes worth over $1 million, and the questions range from “Is it moral for a poor man to steal food?” to “What causes Alzheimer’s disease?” to “Is there a theory that explains all fundamental physical constants?” to “Why do companies that pay dividends get rewarded more by investors?”</p>
					<p>After losing more than a couple hours scouring through these lists, daydreaming of solving just a single problem, I realized my favorite area of study was missing: Marketing. I’ve surveyed some of the smartest marketers and business people I know to come up with a short list of the World’s Unsolved Marketing Problems. We don’t have a $1 million prize set up yet, but we’re working on it.</p>
					<h3 class="section-heading">Trusting Self-Driving Cars</h3>
					<p>There is no doubt that the technology for safe self-driving cars is right around the corner. There are a small number of cars driving by themselves on the streets right now. But the general public does not trust them. Statistically, these cars are already safer than human drivers. But visit any news sites, forum, or social media site and it will be covered with seething distrust. Will there be a genius marketer who learns how to sway the opinions of billions of drivers to trust the machine, or will we have to wait for a few generations to die out before everyone truly believes?</p>
					<h3 class="section-heading">Automating All of Marketing</h3>
					<p>Marketing automation is one of the loudest buzzwords of 2016. Every company in adtech has an automation feature - and for good reason. Machine learning (Artificial Intelligence) is capable of incredible feats. For example, many native advertising platforms don’t require any manual set up: simply supply a URL and the AI will read your content, find the right audience for it, and optimize towards your goals. If the trend continues, can all of marketing be optimized? Could an AI analyze the data from your website to build ads and buy traffic with no human interaction? Could it A/B test new pricing schemes, websites layouts, and email messages to drive more revenue?</p>
					<h3 class="section-heading">Eating Bugs</h3>
					<p>The creation of food is responsible for a large number of problems in western society. Meat is unsustainable and takes multiple times more resources to grow than plants. Plants take up too much space, water, and require poisonous sprays. Healthy food is becoming increasingly expensive. Eating insects solves many of these problems. They are low cost, easy and efficient to produce, and can taste great. But the general public in the West simply won’t have it. Other cultures eat insects regularly, but no one has convinced the majority to try it out. The opportunity to profit is huge, the only setback is convincing everyone to try it.</p>
					<h3 class="section-heading">Selling Outerspace</h3>
					<p>Only a small portion of society supports spending billions of dollars on space exploration. Historically, NASA’s funding has only been high during times of war, when their research is needed most. Recently private companies (like SpaceX and Blue Origin) have revived the public’s interest in space exploration. Elon Musk’s claim that humans need to be an interplanetary species has raised eyebrows, but the general public still isn’t convinced. Will someone be able to convince the public it is justified in spending billions of tax dollars to explore the great unknown?</p>
					<h3 class="section-heading">Unidentified Problems</h3>
					<p>Our list of problems is limited to our cultural and geographic point of view. There are huge problems that exist outside of the United States that we are simply not aware of. For example, how can we convince taxi drivers in India that an electric engine is cheaper and safer than a gasoline engine? What problems have you seen out in the wild that are technically already solved, but need a marketer to convince us the solution actually exists?</p>
