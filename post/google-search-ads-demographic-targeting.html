                    <span class="caption text-muted">To go places and do things that have never been done before – that’s what living is all about.</span>
                    
					<p>Google searches are supposed to capture a user’s intent. That is why $71 billion a year is spent on search ads. But many times a single search query isn’t actually enough to capture actual intent, unless it were tied to demographic data. Let’s take a look at a few examples:</p>
					
					<blockquote>QUERY: Pizza delivery near me</blockquote>

                    <p>This user’s intention is to find a restaurant, located near them, that delivers pizza. There is no question about it, they want pizza right now. Papa John’s and Domino's will bid on ad space for this query, trying to sell a user pizza. A click will cost them about $4 and earn them around $15 in revenue.</p>

                    <blockquote>QUERY: Ford Trucks</blockquote>

                    <p>This user’s intention is to purchase a ford truck. Or... this user’s intention is to find pictures of ford trucks for a school project. Or.. this user’s intention is to browse Ford’s website. Each of these users has wildly different intent - which could be identified by their demographic data. Right now, Ford is paying equally for ads served to all of these users. Ford pays $2.50 a click for the 42 year old male construction worker who wants to buy a truck, the 12 year old girl who wants a picture for a school project, and the 17 year old kid who just likes to look at Ford’s website to dream about cars.</p>

					<p>Targeting would be much more efficient if advertisers could use both the search query and demographic data to adjust their bid. Ford would gladly pay hundreds of dollars for a click from a potential truck buyer. But they wouldn’t want to pay $2.50 for the 12 year old kid’s click.</p>
					
				   <h2 class="section-heading">The Answer</h2>

                    <p>We’ve just stumbled upon the answer to our question. Why won’t Google allow demographic targeting in search ads? They would lose money. Targeting only works if you can adjust bids up for valuable customers, and adjust bids down for non-valuable ones. If Ford spent hundreds more on valuable leads it likely wouldn’t outweigh the loss from all those twelve year olds who cost Ford $2.50 a click. The number of searches that potentially show buying intent is pretty large. Lots of people search for a product name with no intent to actually purchase it. But without demographic targeting, the brand is forced to treat each of those searches as a potentially valuable lead.</p>

					<p> Google wants Ford to pay $2.50 for every single click, not $0.50 for some clicks and $100 for others. If you asked a Google rep for an answer to our question though, they’d undoubtedly preach about upholding user’s privacy, and how matching search data with demographics is a breach of privacy. It might be a breach of privacy, but it’s really just a breach of revenue.</p>
