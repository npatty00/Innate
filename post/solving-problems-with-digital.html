					<p>It is very easy, especially for the older generations, to pigeon hole digital marketing as advertising: “It is only good for reaching younger generations” or “It is good for selling products, but that is it.” The truth is, digital can be used for much more than just marketing. Digital is a quickly changing undefined mess of technology. If wielded effectively, it can solve real business problems: cheap brand awareness research, solving understaffing problems, testing of traditional advertising, and much more.</p>
					<p>Before dishing out $100,000 to a traditional market research firm for a brand awareness study, consider what they will actually be doing. Boiled down to its purest form, they will be asking people if they are familiar with your brand. They can break it down by segments, geographies, or whatever you wish. It is not feasible to go try this yourself, or to spend that kind of money on researching your competitor’s brand. The digital solution? Data about users making Google searches can identify the quantity and location of people searching for your brand. A search report will show how well your brand has penetrated a market - even how well a specific product name has. You can easily compare this against your competitors and their products. Google provides a tool called the “Keyword Planner” where you can find search volumes for any terms segmented by location. Curious how Ford and Chevrolet compare in brand awareness in Baton Rouge, Louisiana (Avg. over the last 12 months)? This report took 1 minute and $0.00 to generate: </p>
					<h3 class="section-heading">Recruiting</h3>
					<p>A common problem many businesses struggle with is understaffing. Certain skilled positions can be hard to keep filled. For example, a local business in Boulder is an artisan framing shop. They take expensive art or high quality photos and find uniquely matching frames to mount the art in. There are two skills involved: Artistic matching of the piece of art to the frame, and a delicate hand to mount the frame without damaging the art. Moving past simply paying for job advertisements, digital can identify the people who would be good at this job and target them. Using 3rd party data, you can purchase an audience that is similar to the one you are searching for (Artists or Photographers in Boulder, who are recently unemployed and make less than $60k) and advertise jobs to them. Unlike paid job advertisements on sites like LinkedIn or Indeed, you know for a fact that you will be reaching qualified applicants.</p>

					<h3 class="section-heading">A/B Testing Terrestrial Ads</h3>
					<p>The most compelling argument for digital to support traditional is testing advertisements. If you are going to spend $50,000 on a billboard, why not test your image at scale beforehand. Instead of choosing one of ten designs at random, run small display campaigns. The results will statistically prove which image is most appealing to consumers. Moving past the basic appeal, you can see which ad actually leads to the most conversions or leads. While digital can be a cheaper, more cost-efficient, and agile choice for marketing, it can also help solve real business problems too.</p>
