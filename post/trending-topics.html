					<p>All marketers dream of the ever-allusive hockey stick graph. We all dream that our daily efforts are simply building blocks - the necessary grunt work that sets the foundation for massive success. At some point in the near feature our brand will literally explode, shooting straight up and into the blue sky. Sales will break records we never thought possible and ROI percentages will float in the thousands.</p>
					<p>Seemingly, the easiest way of achieving that explosion of success is tying your brand to something that is already shooting up. Your brand could easily piggyback off of something else’s success. If you can identify that trend early enough, then tie your brand to it, success is essentially guaranteed. </p>
					<p>The beauty of trending topics is reach. Something like Pokemon Go can start with a tiny amount of followers, but expand into many different social circles. The sheer number of people a trending topic can reach is amazing. The downside to that massive scale is those users are never all relevant to your brand. Your target market exists for a reason - those are the people interested in what you do. Not everyone cares. But that trending topic reaches everyone, so any marketing spend is the opposite of well targeted: catastrophically inefficient. </p>
					<p>The beautiful part of our rocket ship metaphor is over though. If you’ve successfully latched onto a topic, and you’ve shot up, the sky quickly fades. Every rocket ship (and every trending topic) quickly plummets. There is no slow fading away only steep, menacing drops. Your success is short lived, and you’ll quickly end up back where you were before: searching far and wide for another trending topic. But this time you might learn your lesson: While trending topics are good for achieving massive reach (and good for big brand awareness) they don’t last. The users you reach won’t be well targeted, and most won’t care about your marketing message. Do the right thing, and stay away from trending topics unless you’re a big brand that not only has the budget but also needs that widespread brand awareness.</p>
					<p>There are exceptions to the rule of course. Some trends are worth grabbing on to every time you see them. If you see another Pokemon Go, let it pass. But the next time Christmas rolls around you should consider some themed marketing. Trends like holidays and big events (Olympics, World Cup, Super Bowl, etc.) aren’t so risky. They trend slowly up and slowly down, providing a predictable but authentic way to connect with more consumers.</p>
