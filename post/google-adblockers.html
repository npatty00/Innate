					<p>Google makes 89% of its $75 billion in revenue from advertising, so it makes sense that they would dislike ad blockers. The scale of adtech is massive, and its affect on our economy is significant - and worth taking a closer look at. Blocked ads represent a loss in revenue - or so it would seem. Digging deeper into how Google’s revenue is generated, we found that ad blockers actually improve the quality of Google’s product, potentially increasing their revenue.</p>
					<p>Businesses pay Google to serve ads across the internet. Advertisers try to match the person who will see an ad to their target market (who they think will buy their product). Google provides tools in AdWords to not only buy ads, but choose who will see them. This is called targeting.</p>
					<p>The more targeted an ad, the more it will cost the advertiser. For example if I want anyone in the United States to see my ad, it will only cost me $0.05 per person. But If I wanted to target women, ages 45-64, who like outdoor fitness, earn over $95,000, and live in NYC it would cost me significantly more. Google takes a small percent of this cost every time they sell an ad, so a more expensive (more targeted) ad earns them more money.</p>
					<p>We’ve established that both advertisers and Google want more targeted ads. So are users who block ads still a negative?</p>
					<p>The most basic targeting strategies pick out things like gender and location. If your storefront business is in NYC, you likely only want New Yorkers to see your ad. Someone from LA wouldn’t care about your ad, and wouldn’t click on it. By the same logic, we can argue that users who block ads are GOOD. Let’s replace NYC with the average user, and LA with a user who blocks ads.</p>
					<p>These users have self-targeted. They have explicitly told Google and advertisers that they aren’t interested in seeing ads, and won’t click them. Businesses don’t want to serve ads to users who aren’t interested in seeing them. Neither does Google. These users have essentially created better targeting. And how does Google earn money? From better targeted ads. </p>
					<p>
					
					<h3 class="section-heading">Premise 1: Adblocking users self-target, removing them from the targeted pool. </h3>
					<h3 class="section-heading">Premise 2: Adblockers improve targeting</h3>
					<h3 class="section-heading">Premise 3: Google earns more revenue from better targeted ads</h3>
					<h3 class="section-heading">Conclusion: Google earns more money from adblockers</h3>
					<p> But you’re thinking... “That can’t be correct!” Well you are right. Two big caveats make this argument flawed:</p>
					<p> (1) We are only looking at products that directly provide revenue to Google. While there are plenty of business to consumer products, many don’t create revenue right now. Adblockers might generate more advertising revenue, but hurt Google in other ways.</p>
					<p> (2) This idea is completely flawed when applied to the real world. There are different ways to purchase an ad (based on viewers, clicks, or other metrics). This argument assumes only cost per impression ads are being purchased.</p>
					<p>Despite not being entirely accurate, it is interesting to consider the economics behind Google’s offering. At such a massive scale the adtech industry has large economic implications, many of which haven’t existed for more than a decade. Many people argue there is an adtech bubble, and exploring how adtech works is key to understanding and preparing for that possibility.</p>
