					<p>Referral spam is nothing new. Google analytics has been hit by spam for years. While GA filters most bot traffic by default some does slip through the cracks. Less than noble marketers will send huge chunks of bot traffic to your site in hopes of you seeing it in your analytics. After seeing an odd traffic spike, you’ll investigate. You’ll find that referral traffic has increased dramatically - from a site like socialbuttons.xyz. But you’ve never posted content there! Wondering why you’re getting so much traffic you’ll inevitably click over to that site. </p>
					<p>But you’ve just fallen into their trap. The goal all along was to get you to visit their site. Often times the site is trying to sell you a piece of marketing software, farm your cookies, or something more nefarious. </p>
					<p>These traps are convincing the first time around but are blatantly easy to spot after that. A couple clicks will filter them out easily (link). Recently though, someone has gotten very creative. We don’t normally write blog posts praising spammers and blackhats, but this one is unique!</p>
					<p>The first trap is something we’ve never seen before. By modifying data in the header, the spammer has created his own language elegantly named “Secret.google.com You are invited! Enter only with this ticket URL. Copy it. Vote for Trump!”</p>
					<p>This is obviously spam, but will pique most marketer’s curiosity. If you copy the url you’ll find it is not actually secret.google.com but that the first “G” in “google” has been replaced by the Cycrillic character that looks exactly like a smaller, uppercase “G”. The spammer owns a domain that looks exactly like google.com. This sophistication is interesting in itself, but the rabbit hole continues.</p>
					<p>When adding a secondary dimension of “Full Referrer” you can usually find where a link to your site was posted. It would appear as though this spammer posted links to your site on many respectable websites! Lifehacker.com, Reddit.com, Stackexchange.com, and Thenextweb.com all link to your site now. But again, the hacker has modified data in the header to falsify this data. Impressive, but nothing new. </p>
					<p>The spammer has a sense of humour though. These referring links lead to comment threads and news articles about the spammer. Reddit has hundreds of comments from marketers complaining how they found the comment thread through referrer spam. The news article is specifically about this spam and even how to defeat it. The lifehacker link is actually fake - it uses the Cyrillic character that looks like a “K” but isn’t. </p>
					<p>This spammer hasn’t caused much harm, but his or her methods are more impressive than usual. They’ve prompted a strong reaction from the online community. Likely the spammer was testing a new tool, given how successful and widespread the attack was. If you’ve been affected by this spammer or similar, there is an easy fix (link).</p>
