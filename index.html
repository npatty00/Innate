		<p>Google searches are supposed to capture a user’s intent. That is why $71 billion a year is spent on search ads. But many times a single search query isn’t enough to capture actual intent, unless it were tied to demographic data. Let’s take a look at a few examples. <a href="post/google-search-ads-demographic-targeting.html"><strong>Read More...</strong></a></p>

    <h3><a href="post/roi-of-logo.html">The ROI of a Logo</a></h3>
		<p>If you asked a preschooler to describe their favorite cigarette brand, they wouldn’t have an answer. They’ve never experienced the product, can’t describe its features, and don’t really understand what a cigarette is. But show any child a Camel logo, and they can match the brand’s logo with the brand’s product. Not only do they recognize the logo (and the brand) but they can match it characteristics chosen by marketers. <a href="#"><strong>Read More...</strong></a></p>

		<p>UTM parameters attach a small amount of data to the end of a URL. This enables marketers to add and control specific data about a link: where the link was posted, what keywords are relevant to the link, what advertising campaign the link is a part of, and to differentiate between ad creative/copy. This data is sent to Google Analytics and can then be analyzed. <a href="post/how-to-use-utm-parameters.html"><strong>Read More...</strong></a></p>

The mirror is made from a deconstructed 40" LED TV behind a one way mirror, so every black pixel is "replaced" with the reflection. Any image shines through as long as its bright, and the background is black. <a href="#"><strong>Read More...</strong></a></p>
